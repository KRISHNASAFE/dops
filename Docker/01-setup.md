I am using Virtualbox VMs for this exercise and rest all exercises in this folder.
My machine is Windows so mostly I have done setup for it but can surely help together for Linux, MacOS. 

Step 1: 
Install Virtual box on your machine. 
Link: -
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
Choose your operating system & click on download button. 

For Windows: -
Extract the downloaded file, choose default settings mostly but if you know and want customization you can proceed, I moved with standard given approach & installed VB on machine. 

For Linux: -
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads 
You can follow this tutorial provided. 

Step 2: -
Once VB installation is done, we proceed with creation of vm. 

a. Open VB & click new then dialogue box will open.

b. Give name to your machine, select folder where you want to place all files related to your VM then select the downloaded image for your choosen linux flavours. 
I have hide my path here.

d. Select hardware ----> provide memory for your VM, mostly 2GB is sufficient(some free VMs in cloud based system provide 1GB memory & 1 CPU and most of task are handled by those system well for learning purpose.)
Select cpu to 1 or 2 depending on your system specifications. In enterprise systems size will be more than this of course,

e. Provide hard disk capacity & click finish. Wait for some time to spin up vm.

*******If you are well versed with networking you can change and play with network tab for this VMs for current, I have kept everything default. ******
This is how we will simply create a VM in VB.
